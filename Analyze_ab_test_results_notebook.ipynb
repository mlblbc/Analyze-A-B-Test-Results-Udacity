    "There is not enough evidence that the new_page increases the conversion rate as compared to the __old_page__. This is based on the probability figures, A/B testand regression. There is no strong evidence that the countries (__CA__ , __US__ and __UK__) influence the conversion rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sample size is large continuing the testing of the new_page is likely not necessary. It is best to focus on the development of another new landing page."
